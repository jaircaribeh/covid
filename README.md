# covid- SQL

Analysis of covid 19 in the world and a special analysis for Brazil using BigQuery and Google DtaStudio



This analysis is a study of COVID 19 using SQL as a language on Google platforms such as BigQuery and Google Data Studio.  First step was to choose the database that was taken from the website.  Soon after, I studied the data to understand what it was possible to do and tell a story through these data collected from the website.

So with that compression I can know what I could do to present the data.

Show the world data of new cases, and new cases of death by covid.

Analyze covid in brazil and point out which regions were most affected.

Show the total number of new cases

Show the total number of new deaths


CSV files were uploaded to the BigQuery platform and analyzed that there were some values ​​missing.  For these values ​​I replace the with the ND value.  Some column names were also substituted.  I created two new tables and loaded the treated data inside it.

Right after I made the dashboard using Google Data Studio
